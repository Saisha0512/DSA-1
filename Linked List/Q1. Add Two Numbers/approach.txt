ALGORITHM:
1. Create a dummy node which is the head of new linked list.

2. Create a node temp initialised to dummy.

3. Initialize carry to 0.

4. Initialize two nodes: 't1' to head of list 1 and 't2' to head of linked list 2.

5. Loop through both list until we reach end of both the linked list and carry becomes zero.
        (a) Initialise a variable 'sum' to 0.

        (b) Check if t1 is not null.
                A. sum = sum + value of t1.
                B. Increment t1.

        (c) Check if t2 is not null.
                A. sum = sum + value of t2.
                B. Increment t2.

        (d) Increment sum with carry.

        (e) Update carry with sum / 10.

        (f) Create a new node with the digit value of (sum % 10) and set it to temp's node next. Finally update temp with temp = temp's next;

6. Return dummy's next node.
