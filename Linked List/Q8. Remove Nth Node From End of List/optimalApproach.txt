Optimal approach is by using "Tortoise Hare Algorithm"

ALGORITHM:
1. Initialise two pointers 'slow' and 'fast' to head.

2. Initially, only 'fast' pointer will move till it crosses N nodes.

3. After that both pointer will move simultaneously.

4. Traverse the linked list till the 'fast' reaches last node. At this stage, 'slow' pointer is on (length - N)th node.

5. Point the 'slow' pointer to (length - N + 2)th node effectively skipping Nth node from end.
